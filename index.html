    	<h4>About Cirakas</h4>

    	<h4>Living in Full Spectrum</h4>
    	<h6>At Cirakas, our colours pulse with purpose—they're the unspoken
			manifesto of how we reinvent the ordinary. Every hue tells our
			story: of demo-driven teams where code speaks louder than titles,
			where "I don't know" opens doors to collective genius. This vibrant
			energy flows through our standups, electrifies our whiteboard
			sessions, and warms the spaces where breakthroughs happen
			over shared meals.

    	<h4>AI, Tech and more</h4>
    	<h6>We're a vibrant, young team of tech enthusiasts building cuttingedge solutions in healthcare and energy conservation. Our developers work with the full spectrum of modern web
			technologies - from JavaScript frameworks like React.js, Vue.js,
			AngularJS, and Next.js to powerful backend stacks using Node.js,
			Express.js, and NestJS.
			We craft beautiful, responsive interfaces with CSS3, SASS, Tailwind
			CSS, and Material UI, while leveraging TypeScript for robust code.
			Always innovating, we embrace NoCode platforms and AI
			technologies to accelerate development, using AI Agents to

    	<h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
    	<h6>We wear our values visibly—not as decoration, but as a constant
			reminder that great work demands both courage and care. Here,
			transparency isn't policy but practice, where junior voices
			challenge assumptions as boldly as our products disrupt
			industries. Our palette mirrors what we prize most: the clarity to
			see problems anew, the conviction to own outcomes, and the
			creative freedom to build what matters.
			This is how culture becomes tangible—not through rules, but
			through living colour</h6>
